# Excursion: A Learning Experience

This site was built to practice using git, GitHub, Bash, Markdown, HTML, and CSS, following the Codecademy [Learn Git & GitHub](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) course.

I accomplished:
- Install and learn Bash
- Install and learn git
- Create a repository on GitHub
- Create a GitHub Pages repository
- Create a website by coding HTML & CSS in notebook and pushing to my git repo
- Connect that repo to my GitHub Pages site
- Learn Markdown and use it to format this README

Eventually, this site will be unpublished as I build out more sophisticated projects.
